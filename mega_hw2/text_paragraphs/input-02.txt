Welcome to the Very Cheesy Podcast, where we discuss all things cheese. This is your host, Pavlos Protopapas. We all love cheese, and we all love learning about it. The cheese of the day is halloumi. Halloumi cheese, from the island of Cyprus, was first mentioned in ancient times. For most Cypriots, halloumi is synonymous with cheese. It's unique to this beautiful island in the Mediterranean. 

Halloumi is a semi-hard, brined cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk, though cow's milk is sometimes added. It has a slightly salty, tangy flavor and a chewy texture. The unique characteristic of halloumi is its ability to be grilled, fried, or pan-fried without melting. This is due to its high protein content and the addition of a natural coagulant called rennet. 

The history of halloumi is as rich and flavorful as the cheese itself. It's believed to have originated in the mountainous regions of Cyprus, where shepherds would use the milk from their flocks to make cheese. The name "halloumi" is thought to come from the Turkish word "hellim," which means "to salt." This refers to the traditional method of preserving the cheese by brining it in salt water. 

Halloumi has been a staple food in Cyprus for centuries, and it's now enjoyed all over the world. It's a versatile cheese that can be used in a variety of dishes, from salads and sandwiches to grilled skewers and pasta dishes. 

One of the most popular ways to enjoy halloumi is grilled. The cheese is often grilled until it's golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside, while remaining soft and chewy on the inside. It's then served with a variety of accompaniments, such as grilled vegetables, salad, or bread. 

Another popular way to enjoy halloumi is fried. The cheese is often fried until it's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's then served with a variety of dips, such as hummus, tzatziki, or baba ghanoush.
